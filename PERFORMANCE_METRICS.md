# Performance Metrics and Benchmarks

### What to Measure:

- Job Processing Throughput: Number of jobs processed per second.
- Worker Utilization: CPU and memory usage of worker instances.
- Redis Performance: Latency and throughput of the job queue.
- Auto-Scaling Response Time: Time taken to scale up or down workers.

### How to Measure:

- Use AWS CloudWatch for:
  - EC2 Metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage.
  - Auto-Scaling Metrics: Scaling activity and response time.
- Use Grafana for:
  - Redis metrics like latency and connections.
  - Custom job processing metrics (via monitoring scripts).

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Job Processing Throughput

**Test Setup**:

- 3 worker nodes.
- 1000 jobs enqueued.

**Result**:

- Average throughput: 200 jobs/second.

### 2. Worker Utilization

**Test Setup**:

- Monitor CPU and memory usage under varying loads.

**Result**:

- 70% average CPU utilization for a queue length of 1000.

### 3. Redis Performance

**Test Setup**:

- Measure latency and connections during high job enqueue rates.

**Result**:

- Average latency: 5ms for 100 concurrent connections.

### 4. Auto-Scaling Response Time

**Test Setup**:

- Enqueue jobs to trigger scaling.

**Result**:

- Scaling up time: 2 minutes.
- Scaling down time: 5 minutes.
